# Instagram Development Mode Issue - CONFIRMED

## Problem Identified ✅

Your logs show:
- ✅ Webhook verification works (GET request successful)
- ❌ No POST webhooks when real messages are sent
- ❌ No "WEBHOOK RECEIVED" logs from real Instagram messages

This confirms your Instagram app is in **Development Mode** and only receives webhooks from test users.

## Solution: Add Test Users

Since getting Instagram app approval can take weeks, the quickest solution is to add test users:

### Step 1: Add Test Users in Facebook Developers

1. **Go to**: https://developers.facebook.com/apps/[YOUR_APP_ID]/roles/test-users/
2. **Click "Add Test Users"**
3. **Add the Instagram accounts** you want to test with
4. **Grant permissions**: `instagram_basic`, `instagram_manage_messages`

### Step 2: Accept Test User Invitations

1. **Log into the Instagram accounts** you added as test users
2. **Accept the test user invitation** (you'll get a notification)
3. **Connect the Instagram account** to your Facebook app

### Step 3: Test Again

1. **Send a message** from the test user account to `get_voyage`
2. **Check Heroku logs** - you should now see:
   ```
   ==================================================
   WEBHOOK RECEIVED
   ==================================================
   Raw webhook data: {...}
   ```

## Alternative: Request App Review (Long-term Solution)

For production use with any Instagram account:

1. **Go to**: https://developers.facebook.com/apps/[YOUR_APP_ID]/app-review/permissions/
2. **Request review for**: `instagram_manage_messages`
3. **Provide detailed explanation** of how you'll use the permission
4. **Wait for approval** (can take 1-2 weeks)

## Quick Test: Story Replies

Sometimes story replies work even in development mode:

1. **Post an Instagram story** on `get_voyage`
2. **Reply to the story** from another account
3. **Check logs** for webhook activity

## Verify Your App Mode

Check if your app is in development mode:

1. **Go to**: https://developers.facebook.com/apps/[YOUR_APP_ID]/settings/basic/
2. **Look for "App Mode"** - if it says "Development", that's the issue
3. **To go live**: You need app review approval

## Expected Behavior After Fix

Once test users are added, your logs should show:

```
==================================================
WEBHOOK RECEIVED
==================================================
Raw webhook data: {
  "entry": [
    {
      "id": "...",
      "messaging": [
        {
          "sender": {"id": "USER_ID"},
          "recipient": {"id": "PAGE_ID"},
          "message": {
            "text": "Hello",
            "mid": "..."
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
Processing entry 1: {...}
Number of messaging events in entry 1: 1
Processing messaging event 1: {...}
Received message from USER_ID: Hello
Message sent successfully to USER_ID
==================================================
```

## Summary

Your bot code is working perfectly! The issue is Instagram's development mode restrictions. Add test users to immediately fix this, or request app review for full production access.
